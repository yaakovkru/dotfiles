# My dotfiles

Some of the dotfiles that I'm using right now. 

### Tmux

* Vim key bindings for movement.
* [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) - Tmux plugin manager.
* [dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/tmux) - with some my specific configuration.

### VIM
I'm currently using an IDE with VIM keymap. So I kept my vim as simple as possible with basic configurations.

Enjoy!
